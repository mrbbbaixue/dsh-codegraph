/**
 * B1: the static CodeGraph guide injected as a system-prompt section.
 *
 * This is codegraph's own `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` — the MCP `initialize.instructions`
 * playbook — carried over in full, not trimmed. The MCP path never delivered it
 * to dsh (the harness's MCP client drops the `instructions` field), so the plugin
 * owns the channel.
 *
 * Five deltas from the upstream text, each one a clause that would be false here:
 *
 *   1. `codegraph_index` is named. Upstream says "there is a single tool"; this
 *      plugin's `core` surface has two, and the index tool is its own invention.
 *   2. The deferred-tool clause is gone. dsh has no "listed but deferred" state
 *      (ADR-0004): an unregistered tool does not exist at all.
 *   3. `projectPath` is `path` — this plugin's argument name — and the
 *      "(no live watcher)" parenthetical is dropped: every root this plugin
 *      queries has its own resident session, so all of them are watched.
 *   4. The unindexed-project limitation states this plugin's actual behavior
 *      (the first query builds the index) instead of upstream's "don't run init
 *      yourself".
 *   5. The `CODEGRAPH_EXPLORE_DEDUP` paragraph is dropped. That opt-in is safe
 *      only for a host with ONE durable context per connection; this plugin
 *      multiplexes every dsh session onto one resident connection per project,
 *      so cross-call dedup would suppress source another session never saw.
 *
 * Everything else is byte-for-byte upstream. Kept in its own module so the
 * wording can be reviewed and edited without touching registration logic.

export const CODEGRAPH_GUIDE = `# Codegraph — code intelligence over an indexed knowledge graph

Codegraph is a SQLite knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file in
the workspace — pre-computed structure you would otherwise re-derive by
reading files (cached intelligence: thousands of parse/trace decisions you
don't pay to re-reason each run). It indexes 30+ languages
(TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift,
Kotlin, and more) — don't assume a language here isn't covered. Reads are
sub-millisecond; the index lags writes by ~1s through the file watcher. Reach for it BEFORE *and* while
writing or editing code — not just for questions: one call returns the
verbatim source PLUS who calls it and what it affects, so you edit with the
blast radius in view. More accurate context, in far fewer tokens and
round-trips than reading files yourself.

## One strong tool: codegraph_explore — use it instead of reading files

\`codegraph_explore\` is the primary tool and it is Read-equivalent. It
takes either a natural-language question or a bag of symbol/file names and
returns the **verbatim, line-numbered source** of the relevant symbols
grouped by file — the same \`<n>\\t<line>\` shape \`Read\` gives you, safe to
\`Edit\` from — PLUS the call path among them (including dynamic-dispatch hops
like callbacks, React re-render, and JSX children that grep can't follow) and
a blast-radius summary of what depends on them.

The second tool, \`codegraph_index\`, builds or refreshes the index
(\`operation: init | sync | index\`). You rarely need it: a missing index is
built for you on the first query, and a resident file watcher keeps it
current. Use it deliberately only when a query tells you it could not build one
— \`init\` and \`index\` ask the user for approval first, \`sync\` does not.

Whether you're answering "how does X work" or implementing a change (fixing a
bug, adding a feature), call \`codegraph_explore\` before you Read. ONE call
usually answers the whole question. Codegraph IS the pre-built search index —
so running your own grep + read loop, or delegating the lookup to a separate
file-reading sub-task/agent, repeats work codegraph already did and costs more
for the same answer. A direct codegraph answer is typically one to a few
calls; a grep/read exploration is dozens.

## How to query

- **Almost any question — "how does X work", architecture, a bug, "what/where is X", or surveying an area** → \`codegraph_explore\` with a natural-language question or the relevant names. ONE capped call returns the verbatim source grouped by file; most often the ONLY call you need.
- **"How does X reach/become Y? / the flow / the path from X to Y"** → \`codegraph_explore\`, naming the symbols that span the flow (e.g. \`mutateElement renderScene\`) — it surfaces the call path among them, riding dynamic-dispatch hops, and returns their source.
- **Reading or editing a file/symbol you can name** → put its name or file path in the \`codegraph_explore\` query — it returns that current line-numbered source (safe to \`Edit\` from) with the call path and blast radius attached, so you don't Read it separately. For an overloaded name it returns every matching definition's body in one call.
- **Need more?** Call \`codegraph_explore\` again with more specific names — treat the source it returns as already Read. Suggested call counts are advisory only, NOT a quota; extra calls are never rejected or rate-limited.
- Qualified symbol names accept dots, \`::\`, or slashes, including containers whose names contain dots (for example, \`AppWeb.Format.group\`).
- Named-symbol call paths require exact matches; partial or mistyped names are never silently substituted as flow endpoints. If a graph query reports a missing symbol with did-you-mean suggestions, query the suggested name explicitly.

## Anti-patterns

- **Trust codegraph's results — don't re-verify them with grep.** They come from a full AST parse; re-checking with grep is slower, less accurate, and wastes context.
- **Don't grep or Read first** to find or understand indexed code — ONE \`codegraph_explore\` returns the relevant symbols' source together in a single round-trip. Reach for raw \`Read\`/\`Grep\` only to confirm a specific detail codegraph didn't cover, or for what codegraph doesn't index (configs, docs).
- **Don't reconstruct a flow by hand** — name the endpoints in one \`codegraph_explore\` and it surfaces the path between them, dynamic-dispatch hops included.
- **After editing, check the staleness banner.** When a tool response starts with "⚠️ Some files referenced below were edited since the last index sync…", the listed files are pending re-index — Read those specific files for accurate content. Every file NOT in that banner is fresh, so still trust codegraph. A different, rarer banner — "⚠️ CodeGraph auto-sync is DISABLED…" — means live watching stopped entirely (the whole index is frozen, not just a few files); until it's resolved, Read files directly to confirm anything that may have changed.
- **A file flagged "⚠ changed on disk after the last index sync" drifted from its index.** Codegraph never serves a possibly-mis-sliced body from such a file — it either shows the file's full CURRENT source (trust it as a Read) or omits the source with this flag. When the source was omitted, Read that specific file; line numbers referencing it elsewhere in the response may be shifted until that project's next sync. All unflagged files remain trustworthy.

## Limitations

- A workspace with no \`.codegraph/\` index is neither a finding to report nor a reason to fall back to grep: the first \`codegraph_explore\` builds the index. Only when a query still reports that codegraph is unavailable — automatic indexing is switched off, the build failed, or the project is larger than the configured file ceiling — call \`codegraph_index\` with \`operation: init\`, which asks the user first. Once a query says the workspace is not indexed and the user declined to index it, stop calling codegraph for that project and use the built-in tools there.
- Index lags file writes by ~1 second.
- Cross-file resolution is best-effort name matching; ambiguous calls may return multiple candidates.
- No live correctness validation — that's still the TypeScript compiler / test suite / linter's job. Codegraph supplements those with structural context they don't have.`
